# U-FNOB
## Description
U-FNOB is a GitHub repository that provides the implementation of the U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO) architecture for predicting groundwater contamination levels under different climate scenarios and subsurface properties. Soil and groundwater contamination is a pervasive global issue that poses a severe threat to human health and the environment. Traditional models used to simulate contaminant concentrations under different climate scenarios are computationally expensive and require high-performance computing. U-FNOB offers a fast surrogate flow and transport model that leverages a physics-informed machine learning technique to address this challenge.The U-FNOB architecture is designed to predict spatiotemporal variations of groundwater flow and contaminant transport properties such as contaminant concentration, hydraulic head, and Darcy's velocity. It integrates a custom loss function including data-driven factors and physical boundary constraints, enabling reliable predictions of groundwater contamination levels under uncertain climate scenarios.The U-FNOB-R architecture is a variant of U-FNOB that is specifically optimized for predicting the impact of changes in recharge rate on groundwater contamination sites. U-FNOB-R offers better time-dependent predictions than the U-FNOB architecture, making it an ideal choice for predicting the impact of changes in recharge rate on groundwater contamination sites.U-FNOB is an innovative approach that has the potential to transform the field of environmental monitoring and remediation. It provides a fast, accurate, and cost-effective solution for predicting groundwater contamination levels under uncertain climate scenarios, and it has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of environmental monitoring and remediation efforts.
## Data Preparation and Training
While there is no installation process, users can run the provided files to prepare data and train models. Use the following Jupyter notebooks to convert raw simulation files into an appropriate format for machine learning:

- `data-prep-multi-output.ipynb`
- `data-prep-multi-output-recurrent.ipynb`

The transformed data files can be found [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/us-digitaltwiner-pub-features/srs_farea_ensemble_simulations_dataset/processed_sim_data).
The RAW simulation files can be found [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/us-digitaltwiner-pub-features/srs_farea_ensemble_simulations_dataset).
Run `training.py` to train either the U-FNOB or U-FNOBR models. 
Pretrained models can be found [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/us-digitaltwiner-pub-features/srs_farea_ensemble_simulations_dataset/final_models).
